# RNN-specific requirements for AutoML project
# Install with: pip install -r requirements-rnn.txt

# PyTorch - Core deep learning framework for RNN models
# GPU acceleration:
#   - Apple Silicon (M1/M2/M3/M4): MPS backend has stability issues with RNNs,
#     CPU is used by default. MPS can be enabled explicitly if needed.
#   - NVIDIA GPU: Install CUDA version from https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/
#   - Note: CUDA is NOT available on Mac (NVIDIA GPUs only)
#
# Known issues:
#   - Python 3.14+: XGBoost conflicts with PyTorch causing segmentation faults.
#     Use --rnn-only mode or Python 3.11 for full compatibility.
torch>=2.0.0

# Base requirements (also needed for RNN functionality)
numpy>=1.21.0
pandas>=1.3.0
